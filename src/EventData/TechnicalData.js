Each PDF will have a link to the next PDF which will be protected with a password as an answer to the previous PDF. Participants who reach the last PDF will receive a special keyword and then have to confirm that keyword with the event organizer.The first 5 participants confirming the code will pass through this hurdle.Round 3 Participants will be provided with a circuit which will have to build that circuit on a multisim platform and take a snapshot of the output and send it to the organizer. The participants who confirm the first output will be the winners.",

For the remaining 3 questions (3 marks), incorrect logic code will be given, the participants will need to debug it and correct the logic.Round 3 Coding rounds at coding events is a nightmare.
